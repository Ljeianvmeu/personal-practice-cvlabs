# Basic Image Classification using PyTorch

In this lab session, you will build a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch. The CNN will classify images stored in the `Data/training_set` and `Data/test_set` folders. We will follow the steps of data preprocessing, defining a simple CNN, training the model, and evaluating its performance.


## Introduction

PyTorch is one of the most widely used deep learning libraries that you can use to build a CNN. CNNs are particularly effective for image recognition tasks, making them ideal for applications such as facial recognition, self-driving cars, and medical image analysis. In this lab, we will work through the process of building a basic CNN for binary image classification, similar to the popular "Cats vs. Dogs" classification problem.

By the end of this session, you will understand how to:

- Define and initialize a CNN model in PyTorch.
- Apply convolution and pooling operations to extract features from images.
- Use data augmentation to increase the robustness of the model.
- Train the CNN model using the binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.
- Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this lab, students will be able to:

1. Understand the architecture and components of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
2. Implement a CNN in PyTorch to classify images.
3. Perform data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
4. Train and evaluate the CNN model using PyTorch's training loop and metrics.
5. Visualize and interpret model accuracy and performance metrics.

This exercise builds a strong foundation in deep learning and prepares students for more advanced topics in neural networks, such as transfer learning and object detection.

## Instructions

Please follow these steps to complete the lab:

1. **Step 1: Data processing**

2. **Step 2: Model definition**

You are asked to write a short (no more than 2 pages) report of your work, completing the tasks and answering the questions. This work is not assessed (it will not count towards your module mark) but you will get formative feedback. Make sure to refer to the comments in the code for guidance. Feel free to experiment with different architectures or hyperparameters (e.g., number of layers, number of filters, learning rate) to see how they affect the performance.
